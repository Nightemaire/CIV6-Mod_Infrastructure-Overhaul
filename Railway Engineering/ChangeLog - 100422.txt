Railway Engineer

Railyard
- Reduced the production yield from 4 to 2
- When complete, railroads will now be built from the Railyard to the City
- Reduced Great Engineer points from 2 to 1

Theodore Judah
- Now has 2 charges - each still builds a railyard and increases regional range
- Regional range increase reduced from 3 to 2
- Each activation now also builds a "Transcontinental Railstation" in the city's center
- Fixed an issue where his ability might not function correctly between saves

Tunnels

== New Features ==

Building: Transcontinental Railstation
- A new building in the city center (+5 gold, +2 Great Merchant Points)
- Only two can exist in your empire
- They require a lot of production - so place them wisely...
- Once both are complete, if there is a traversable path (see requirements below), construction of the Transcontinental Railroad will commence
- Traversable Requirements:
- - Must be connected by land - the route will fail if water separates the two stations
- - There must be a path that is either owned entirely by you, or by no one. The route will not pass through other player's borders
- - Natural Wonders and volcanos are not valid tiles for the route

Transcontinental Railroad
- Once initiated, the required tiles for the route will be claimed for your empire
- Railroads will be automatically built out from each station to meet in the middle, at a rate adjusted for game speed
- The route will tunnel through mountains if it makes sense
- The route prefers flatland tiles over hills, but also attempts to maintain a straight course where possible

Building: Subway Network
-
